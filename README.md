## Inspiration
We were inspired by the common challenge of tracking and splitting expenses in group settings. Whether it's friends, roommates, or event attendees, we wanted to make the process simple, transparent, and fun. Our goal was to eliminate confusion and awkwardness around finances, so people could focus on enjoying the moment rather than worrying about who owes whom.

## What it does
Splitzy allows groups to input their expenses on a shared page, automatically calculating who owes what and to whom. The AI chatbot helps users throughout the process, ensuring everything is clear and easy to track. It’s a seamless way to manage shared costs for any event, trip, or casual hangout.

## How we built it
We built Splitzy using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, with a focus on user experience. The front-end was developed with HTML, while the back-end was powered by Flask and python. We also integrated an AI chatbot to streamline the process and provide user assistance. Collaboration and dynamic user input were key components in designing the system.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges around ensuring real-time updates for users, making sure calculations were always accurate, and integrating the AI chatbot seamlessly. Handling multiple user inputs at once while maintaining a smooth experience was a technical hurdle, but we overcame it with effective system design and testing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of how quickly we were able to build a functional prototype that not only works well but also includes an AI chatbot that assists users. The real-time expense tracking and dynamic cost-splitting feature is something we're particularly excited about, as it’s both practical and fun.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about the importance of seamless user experience, especially when dealing with collaborative tools. We also learned how to work with real-time data synchronization, AI integration, and ensuring that calculations are accurate and transparent for all users. The process taught us a great deal about teamwork, problem-solving, and creative thinking in a hackathon environment.

## What's next for Splitzy
Next, we plan to refine the user interface and expand the features, including multi-currency support, customizable categories for expenses, and perhaps deeper AI functionality, such as automatic expense suggestions. We also plan to launch the product for broader user testing to get feedback and improve scalability.
